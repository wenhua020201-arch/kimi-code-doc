# `kimi acp` subcommand

The `kimi acp` command starts a multi-session ACP (Agent Client Protocol) server.

```sh
kimi acp
```

## Description

ACP is a standardized protocol that allows IDEs and other clients to interact with AI Agents.

## Use Cases

- IDE plugin integration (e.g., JetBrains, Zed)
- Custom ACP client development
- Multi-session concurrent processing

For using Kimi Code CLI in IDEs, please refer to Using in IDEs.

## Authentication

The ACP server checks user authentication status before creating or loading sessions. If the user is not logged in, the server returns an `AUTH_REQUIRED` error (error code `-32000`) with available authentication method details.

After the client receives this error, it should guide the user to run the `kimi login` command in the terminal to complete login. Once logged in, subsequent ACP requests will proceed normally.
